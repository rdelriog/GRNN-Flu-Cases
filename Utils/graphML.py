    EdgeVariantGF Creates a (linear) layer that applies an edge-variant graph
        filter using the masking approach. If less nodes than the total number 
        of nodes are selected, then the remaining nodes adopt an LSI filter
        (i.e. it becomes a hybrid edge-variant grpah filter)

    Initialization:

        EdgeVariantGF(in_features, out_features, shift_taps,
                      selected_nodes, number_nodes,
                      edge_features=1, bias=True)

        Inputs:
            in_features (int): number of input features (each feature is a graph
                signal)
            out_features (int): number of output features (each feature is a
                graph signal)
            shift_taps (int): number of shifts to consider
            selected_nodes (int): number of selected nodes to implement the EV
                part of the filter
            number_nodes (int): number of nodes
            edge_features (int): number of features over each edge
            bias (bool): add bias vector (one bias per feature) after graph
                filtering

        Output:
            torch.nn.Module for a graph filtering layer using hybrid
                edge-variant graph filters.

        Observation: Filter taps have shape
            out_features x edge_features x shift_taps x in_features
                x number_nodes x number_nodes
            These weights are masked by the corresponding sparsity pattern of
            the graph and the desired number of selected nodes, so only weights
            in the nonzero edges of these nodes will be trained, the
            rest of the parameters contain trash. Therefore, the number of
            parameters will not reflect the actual number of parameters being
            trained.

    Add graph shift operator:

        EdgeVariantGF.addGSO(GSO) Before applying the filter, we need to define
        the GSO that we are going to use. This allows to change the GSO while
        using the same filtering coefficients (as long as the number of edge
        features is the same; but the number of nodes can change).

            bias (bool): add bias vector (one bias per feature) after graph
                filtering

        Output:
            torch.nn.Module for a gated graph recurrent layer.

        Observation: Input filter taps have shape
            state_features x edge_features x filter_taps x in_features

            State filter taps have shape
            state_features x edge_features x filter_taps x state_features

    Add graph shift operator:

        GGCRNNCell.addGSO(GSO) Before applying the filter, we need to define
        the GSO that we are going to use. This allows to change the GSO while
        using the same filtering coefficients (as long as the number of edge
        features is the same; but the number of nodes can change).

        Here we also define the GCRNNs for the input and forget gates, as they
        use the same GSO

        Inputs:
            GSO (torch.tensor): graph shift operator; shape:
                edge_features x number_nodes x number_nodes

    Forward call:

        H = GGCRNNCell(X, h0)

        Inputs:
            X (torch.tensor): input data; shape:
                batch_size x sequence_length x in_features x number_nodes
            h0 (torch.tensor): initial hidden state; shape:
                batch_size x state_features x number_nodes

        Outputs:
            H (torch.tensor): output; shape:
                batch_size x sequence_length x state_features x number_nodes
